title: Abstract keyboard driver
desc: |-
  Make the keyboard driver simply pass its input to whoever wants it, perhaps a function pointer that can be
  set in order for the keyboard to ship its stuff over that
  
  The driver also needs to set the LEDs of the keyboard, and it needs to support multiple keyboards (should be simple)
  and also multiple keymaps (i.e we need to abstract the keymap into some sort of other file or something)
